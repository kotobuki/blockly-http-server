# HTTP Server for UIFlow

An elementary HTTP Server block for UIFlow.

## How to use

1. Open UIFlow editor at https://flow.m5stack.com/
2. Navigate to "Custom (Beta)" in the block list and choose the "Open *.m5b file" block
3. Specify "http_server.m5b" to open
4. Click the open button in the upper right corner
5. Specify an example (*.m5f) to open
6. Connect Unit(s) to your M5Stack module if needed
7. Click the run button in the upper right corner

## Notes

- Once you uploaded the code to your M5Stack module, you have to reset it before upload again because the running HTTP server prevents the UIFlow editor from uploading.
